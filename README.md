# Important Notice

I have decided to halt this project to work on better stuff. When i started developing this, i wanted to test out new react native technologies and generally just test stuff out. i wanted to make this complete and feature rich. But i dont think i would be adding anything new to the project. The mangadex website is really good and serves what i wanted to create now.
So CIAO. i will see you in next one. I have archived this for now. i have learned a lot about developing a solo project. I will like to give back to the community something productive. 

This may not be the best project ever. but i will clean this repo up. and hope this will serve as a starting point for a new developer to look through.

# Thank you
